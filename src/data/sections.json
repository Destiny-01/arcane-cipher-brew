      "description": "Welcome, apprentice alchemist! In this enchanted laboratory, you'll learn the ancient art of Private Potion Brewing—a magical parallel to Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). Just as alchemists can transform ingredients without revealing their secrets, FHE allows computations on encrypted data without exposing the underlying information. This mystical journey will teach you how to brew potions (process data) while keeping your recipes (encryption) completely private.",

That's the essence of Fully Homomorphic Encryption! FHE is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data, producing an encrypted result that, when decrypted, matches the result of operations performed on the plaintext."

Traditional encryption requires decryption before computation, creating a vulnerability window.
